One such intersection lies between economics and user experience (UX) design, where insights from both fields can offer unique perspectives on understanding human behavior and shaping products and services. In this exclusive interview, we delve into the thoughts and experiences of Maya Loviere, who seamlessly navigates between the realms of economics and UX design.Maya Loviere is a multifaceted professional with a background in economics and a passion for designing intuitive user experiences. With a rich blend of analytical rigor and creative flair, Maya brings a distinctive perspective to her work, drawing on principles from both economics and design to craft solutions that resonate with users while also achieving business objectives.
